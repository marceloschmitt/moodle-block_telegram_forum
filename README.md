        Click on the target channel then you will find the url displayed on your browser.
        If it's a private channel then the url must be similar to:
        https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=c1018013852_555990343349619165
        For this case, the channel ID would be 1018013852.
        It's important to know that channel's IDs are always negative and 13 characters long!
        So add -100 to it, making the correct ID -1001018013852.
 - Teacher sets the channel link in the block so that students can register.
